About
=====
MarkovBot is an IRC bot built on top of my Markov library, it reads what is said in IRC and when asked (using the !line command), it spits out a sentence generated by Markov.

Requirements
============
At this time, markovbot requires markov to be installed first (as markov isn't quite there yet to be pushed to a remote repository), all the other libraries used are automatically installed however.

Installation
============
To install first one needs to clone Markov, install it, and then to install markovbot simply run buildr install.

Configuration
=============
The configuration is done via the bot.properties file, this should be placed in the directory you want to run the bot from.

Run
===
Copy the bot.properties and run.sh to a new folder, then navigate the that folder and run: ./run.sh, it forks automatically so you're then free to do anything.
